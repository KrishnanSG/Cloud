**Project Completed on 24 March 2019**

This desktop application provides a new platform for instant photo sharing among friends with a simple and faster GUI. Since all your pictures and personal details are stored in an encrypted format so you need not worry about your security or someone stealing your data.


>**Note: The project will be deployed soon along with installation steps.**


**How is this better?**

1. With the help of threading each friend's data is downloaded independently, hence creating better user experience as we have minimized those boring loading screens to a great extent. Download to try it out :) 
2. Since we have focused on photo sharing primarily we believe that we have achieved a faster traffic management, thanks to the script file we developed.
3. All your data is secure and stored in an encrypted form.

# Future Release
1. To add the feature of comment,like and share. 
2. To provide better UI & UX.
3. Enhance speed.
4. Use of SQL to enhance performance.
